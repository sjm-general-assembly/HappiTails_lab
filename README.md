README file for HappiTails Lab

To run program, type:   ruby main.rb

Some notes:
-if I had more time, I would refactor to try and put all puts and gets in to the controller

Also,
I created an alternate main, with a different version of a controller. Was playing around with how I could optimize the use of hashes for controller menus.

to run that version, type: ruby main_alt.rb
